Not worth it
Kind of cheap
Really bad
Didn't work the way we expected
Overpriced for what you get
It worked great but after a 2 days it no longer would connect
Could have been much better
Bad experience with this, would not buy
It came a week late and broke within a day
My grandson opened it and several parts were missing
The trackpad is horrible and it stopped working after a day
Took it to the store 3 times for fixing
Flimsly product that came with a dead battery
